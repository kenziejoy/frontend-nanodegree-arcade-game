## Implementation

The Princess and the Bug
===============================

Get the Frong Princess back to the River without stepping on any Bugs (she's Buddhist).

Use the arrow keys on your key board to move her around.

If you reach the River or squash a bug you're sent back to the begining to try again...

Just like the 8 fold path....sorta.
